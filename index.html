<!-- Psuedo Code for the game!

-First, we want to format the HTML for the game. 
	-We need to have three rows,one for the characters that are available for the user to choose from, which will turn into the "Your Character" row, one for the remaining enemies, and one for the defender once you have chosen one of the three remaining enemies to fight against.

- Then, we will format the CSS for the page, giving the game the aesthetic look and feel of a Star Wars RPG.

- Once that is completed, I will work on the JavaScript first and jQuery using the Psuedo that is in the game.js file. -->
